# Hello :D
* I'm Moultrie, you can call me that or Ainselu if you'd like
* I've been properly coding for about a year since late 2023, my first programming language was perhaps Lua which gave me knowledge of most basic programming concepts that I picked up around then, and later that year I began learning Python from the Automate the Boring Stuff with Python course on Udemy, I had stopped learning or coding for a while after then until I picked Python back up last year, and began learning C++ in late October of 2024
* I'm 13 as of writing (Mon. Jan 27, 2025), my birthday is on Feb. 28th :D
* My interests are in cybersecurity, low level programming, webdev, and game development
* You can reach me at @ainselu on Discord
